# 📌 Project Overview

This Project is designed to track products, vendors, stock movement, reorder status, and inventory valuation through a single integrated workflow.
The system simulates a fully automated reporting setup, where raw transactional data flows through structured calculations, pivots, and conditional logic to deliver decision-ready insights via a dynamic dashboard.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical inventory control, MIS reporting, and dashboard design skills commonly required in operations, supply chain, retail, and FMCG environments.

# 🏢 Real-World Business Problems Solved

## 1️⃣ Lack of Real-Time Stock Visibility

### Problem:
- Operations teams struggle to track current stock levels across products, categories, and warehouses.
### Solution:
- Automated inventory stock calculation linked directly to transaction history
- Live stock quantity and stock value per product
- Warehouse- and category-level visibility via slicers
- ➡ Enables instant stock monitoring without manual calculation.

## 2️⃣ Delayed Reorder Decisions

### Problem:
- Businesses often reorder products too late due to poor visibility of low stock levels.
### Solution:
- Predefined reorder levels per product
- Automated Reorder Status (Yes / No) using conditional logic
- Visual alerts through color scales and icon sets
- ➡ Prevents stock-outs and improves procurement planning

## 3️⃣ Fragmented Data Across Sheets 

### Problem:
- Product data, vendor data, transactions, and reports often exist in silos.
Solution:
- 🔗 Structured sheet flow linking:
- 📦 Product master
- 🤝 Vendor master
- 💲 Transactions
- 🔀 Inventory
- 💵 Purchase planning
- 📊 Reports and dashboard
- ➡ Ensures a single source of truth.

## 4️⃣ Manual & Error-Prone Reporting

### Problem:
- Saves a lot time by automated reports and calculative functions .
### Solution:
- Pivot-based Report Summary with dynamic calculations
- Conditional formatting to highlight critical stock levels
- Dashboard & Inventory auto-updates with every new transaction
- ➡ Reduces reporting time and human error.
